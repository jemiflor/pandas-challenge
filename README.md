As final considerations:

OBSERVABLE TRENDS:

1. District Summary data frame summarizes total number of schools taken to create a report and the key metrics taken into account under one school district.

2. School Summary data frame summarizes to give an overall understanding of individual schools under single school district and their key metrics.

3. Using % overall passing as a key metric, top performing schools versus bottom performing schools, gave a consolidated inference as to how the key metrics influenced the performance of the students in ascending order.

4. Scores based on school type, Charter vs District gave an eyebrow raising performance of students in both reading and in math. It is very impressive to see that charter school outperformed significantly over district schools in all key metrics taken under consideration.

5. Scores based by school spending showed performance had less impact with higher expenses per student.

6. Finally, scores based on size showed how large size schools had significant negative impact on academic performance of the students.
